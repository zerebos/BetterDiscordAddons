# Discontinued

ServerSorter is going away.

It's become unrealistic to sort servers/guilds in the list with the new server folders. If you do would miss the functionality of ServerSorter, do not worry, the functionality will be absorbed into [ServerSearch](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/ServerSearch) at some point, so keep your eyes peeled for that.

# ServerSorter

Adds the ability to do some basic sorting of your servers.

## Features

### Sort Button
Sorter adds a button with context menu to quickly sort the servers.

### Sorting

#### Alphabetical (A > Z)

#### Reverse Alphabetical (Z > A)

#### Chronological by Join Date

#### Reverse Chronological by Join Date

#### Chronological by Server Creation Date

#### Reverse Chronological by Server Creation Date

## Plugin Settings

Currently there are no settings. 

## Known Bugs and Issues
 - Adding a server will cause it to be sorted to the top upon reset
 - Removing a server will probably cause errors on sorting (untested)

## Special Thanks
 - DevilBro (Mirco)#4401 for helping me access the React data.
