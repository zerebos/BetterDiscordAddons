 - You can also switch format chaining order from outside first to inside first which means:
 
`&&##Sample Text##&&` will give you ｔｘｅＴ　ｅｌｐｍａＳ instead of ʇｘǝ┴　ǝｌｄɯɐＳ (May not appear right in browser)

`##&&Sample Text&&##` will give you ʇｘǝ┴　ǝｌｄɯɐＳ instead of ＆＆Ｓａｍｐｌｅ　Ｔｅｘｔ＆＆ (May not appear right in browser)
